# Thale.Info Frontend

This project acts as the frontend of [my website](http://thale.info/). It uses TypeScript, React and Redux. This project was a way to improve my frontend skills and how to deploy and serve web applications. Further it was used as a flashcard service for learning during the bachelor degree and for learning new languages. The website has an authentication function which uses the OAuth service of google.  It was deployed serverless in the google cloud but after stopping to use it for educational purposes I stopped serving it to minimize costs.
